# NanoCV

**NanoCV** is a small (nano) C++(11) library that implements various (non-linear) optimization and machine learning algorithms. The library is used as a sandbox for implementing and testing various image classification and object detection methods.

As the library evolves, command line programs will be supplied for testing various components and for training and testing models.

The library is written to be cross-platform having only Boost, Eigen and Qt as dependencies.

## Concepts

The library is built around several key concepts mapped to C++ object interfaces. The main concepts are the following:

* **task** 

* **loss**

* **model**

* **layer**

* **trainer**
