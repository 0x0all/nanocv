**NanoCV** is a small (nano) library consisting of (non-linear) optimization, machine learning and computer vision utilities. The goal is to improve my C++(11) 
programming skills and to play with cool algorithms.

The programming style is inspired by STL and boost and hopefully consistent across the library. Also C++11 is heavily used because it makes coding fun and 
easier. Finally, the library is written to be cross-platform, generic, clear and easy to use.

NanoCV consists of three modules: 

* the **core** - containing various utilities (e.g. types, thread pool, numerical optimization), 

* the (computer vision) **tasks** - (e.g. image classification, object detection) and 

* the **models** - trained and evaluated on these tasks  (e.g. linear models, neural networks). 

Command line programs are supplied for testing various components and for interfacing with the library.

Dependencies: Boost, Eigen, Qt.
