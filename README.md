**NanoCV** is a small (nano) library consisting of (non-linear) optimization, machine learning and computer vision utilities. The goal is to improve my C++(11) 
programming skills and to play with cool algorithms.

The programming style is inspired by STL and boost and hopefully consistent across the library. Also C++11 is heavily used because it makes coding fun and 
easier. Finally, the library is written more to be generic, clear and easy to use than to be the fastest.

NanoCV consists of three modules: 

* the **core** - containing various utilities (e.g. types, thread pool, numerical optimization), 

* the (computer vision) **tasks** - (e.g. image classification, object detection) and 

* the **models** - trained and evaluated on these tasks  (e.g. linear models, neural networks). 

Command line programs are supplied for testing various components and for interfacing with the library.

Development environment: ArchLinux x64, gcc >4.7, QtCreator. 

Dependencies: Boost, Eigen, Qt.

Operating system: Linux.

Status: work in progress.
