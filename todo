- test program to print model (ncv_info_model -> model structure + convolutions as images)
        - may move the info_task drawing functions to the lib

- faster: convolution layer
	- reduce the number of loops - concatenate convolutions?!

- thread_loop with states should use std::future to obtain the returned values (e.g. gradient & loss value)
	
idea: variational learning (ebbbost)
idea: regularized (bound) loss with the same approach as in nips12a.pdf

- svhn decoding:
	- the sections are not decoded correctly: 
		- the data type of the last two sections is not valid
		- the number of bytes in the last section is not valid

- implement other training methods for the convolution network:
        - auto-encoding: using the unlabeled data (could also try with all samples)
        - train a single layer at a time
        - regularization: l2, symmetry
        - could use genetic algorithms and encode a convolution matrix using e.g. 16 possible values, can impose symmetry-like constrains 
        - could add options to filter the input: e.g. smoothing, normalization, contrast equalization

        - autoencoders: how to generate samples ?!

- add other datasets:
        - INRIA car and person datasets
        - NORB, inria pedestrian detection, inria human detection, dymlerchrysler human detection, face detection, PASCALVoc2011, CALTECH101...

- make install:
	- also copy the headers
