- faster ::backward() -> almost 4 times slower than ::forward()
- faster convolution layer - reduce the number of loops - concatenate convolutions?!

* function to generate a random input that will closely output a given target (class):
	- can be used to check the learning

- thread_loop with states should use std::future to obtain the returned values (e.g. gradient & loss value)
	
- implement other training methods for the convolution network:
	- unsupervised training:
		- new loss (without the output layer): a single output should have a much larger value magnitude than the others 
			(e.g. learn to disintangle the variation modes)
		- than train the output layer with the annotated samples

	- regularization: variational learning (like in ebbbost)
        - regularization: l2, symmetry

- add other datasets:
        - INRIA car and person datasets
        - NORB, inria pedestrian detection, inria human detection, dymlerchrysler human detection, face detection, PASCALVoc2011, CALTECH101...

- svhn decoding:
	- the sections are not decoded correctly: 
		- the data type of the last two sections is not valid
		- the number of bytes in the last section is not valid

- make install:
	- also copy the headers
