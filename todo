- design: nicer way to specify colors than using the current array:
set style line 1 linecolor rgb '#0060ad' linetype 1 linewidth 2  # blue
set style line 2 linecolor rgb '#dd181f' linetype 1 linewidth 2  # red

- analyze the history of the validation errors to check if training should stop:
	- fit a line to the last X measurements and check its angle

	- if this works reliable (early stopping clearly overfitting configurations),
		then can go back to tuning the regularization parameters globally for all epochs (like batch)

- make text.* & file/* independent of boost

- activate the address sanitizer build (clang 3.5 should support it)

- augment training samples (to reduce overfitting):
	- new parameter to all tasks: "noisy=off/on"

	- salt & pepper noise (vary the percentage)
	- translation, scale, various deformations

	- ncv_info_task should also be updated to display the noisy training samples

- GTSD dataset support (after 0.1 release):
	- create both classification and detection tasks
	- build an object detector

- finish the training scripts for other datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, NORB, STL)

- unsupervised learning (after 0.1 release): 
	- unsupervised training:
		- new loss (without the output layer): a single output should have a much larger value magnitude than the others 
			(e.g. learn to disintangle the variation modes)
		- than train the output layer with the annotated samples

- reconstruction regularization (after 0.1 release):
	- for linear & convolution layers -> reuse parameters to easily reconstruct the input

- feature visualization & image generation (after 0.1 release)
