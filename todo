- check the speed improvement if using floats instead of doubles for training MLP0

- investigate why AdaGrad presents that strange bump in the training loss plot

- investigate why NAG is so noisy

- augment training samples (to reduce overfitting):
	- salt & pepper noise (vary the percentage)
	- translation, scale, various deformations

	- test program to generate some augmented training samples

- more experiments with floats instead of doubles:
	- check the impact on MLPs and convolutions
	- are the stochastic methods going to be faster?! (tons of gradient-based linear algebra)

- MAD with index shifts (may speed-up corr2d)

- test program to assess the speed of the 3D convolution/correlation operations

- faster convolution:
 	- build a toeplitz matrix, then the convolution becomes a matrix multiplication:
		- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toeplitz_matrix

        - check if any improvement if using a 3D convolution    

- GTSD dataset support (after 0.1 release):
	- create both classification and detection tasks
	- build an object detector

- finish the training scripts for other datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, NORB, STL)

- unsupervised learning (after 0.1 release): 
	- unsupervised training:
		- new loss (without the output layer): a single output should have a much larger value magnitude than the others 
			(e.g. learn to disintangle the variation modes)
		- than train the output layer with the annotated samples

- reconstruction regularization (after 0.1 release):
	- for linear & convolution layers -> reuse parameters to easily reconstruct the input

- feature visualization & image generation (after 0.1 release)

- thread_loop with states should use std::future to obtain the returned values (e.g. gradient & loss value)
