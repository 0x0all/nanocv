- BUG: line-search failed for LBFGS

- reduce the number of input/output buffers for layers

- faster convolution:
        - check if any improvement if using a 3D convolution    
               
- optimization statistics computed at the layer level: average gradient LInf-norm, number of calls
	- to be printed when the layers are destroyed?
	- this is to investigate why it takes many more iterations to optimize networks with more layers
		(diminishing gradient)

- more efficient way to store & select samples for large datasets:
	- allocate xGB of RAM to store some samples in memory and load the others from the disk
	- e.g. NORB or ImageNet

- thread_loop with states should use std::future to obtain the returned values (e.g. gradient & loss value)
	
- implement other training methods for the convolution network:
	- unsupervised training:
		- new loss (without the output layer): a single output should have a much larger value magnitude than the others 
			(e.g. learn to disintangle the variation modes)
		- than train the output layer with the annotated samples
