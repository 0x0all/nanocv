* add functor to the optimization procedure to process the optimum update

* bootstrapping: start with empty training set + REPEAT (evaluate, sample based on the test error, add samples to training set, train) 

- train/test models:
	- test the training script
	- make cmake work with Qt5 modules

	- FASTER linear training!
		- more efficient: v * u.transpose()

	- experimentation script: train linear models on all datasets (256, 1e-5)

	- regularization: l2, symmetry
	- could add options to filter the input: e.g. smoothing, normalization, contrast equalization

- small ui application to visualize task images

- faster RGB to CIELab transform (goal: 1s single-thread version of the color testing program)

- add other datasets:
	- INRIA car and person datasets
	- NORB, inria pedestrian detection, inria human detection, dymlerchrysler human detection, face detection, PASCALVoc2011, CALTECH101...

- autoencoders: how to generate samples ?!

- may revive/improve the bootstrapping idea:
        - also bootstrap the background of the images containing faces
                => many billions of samples (may require removing some profile faces or some animals 
                        that look very much like frontal faces)
